# Homeworks 
## Summary of Homework 1

#### 1. Umbrella Activities Across the Software Process:
- Umbrella activities are applied throughout the software process, but their focus varies. For example, risk management is more critical during design, while documentation is emphasized during testing. The level of emphasis depends on the project phase and methodology.

#### 2. Applicability of Framework Activities to All Projects:
- Framework activities like communication and planning are applicable to all projects, but the specific tasks vary based on the project's size and complexity. Smaller projects may require less extensive planning compared to larger ones.

#### 3. Difference Between Software and Other Engineering Products:
- Software is intangible, created from ideas rather than physical materials, making it more flexible but also more uncertain and risky compared to tangible engineering products like hardware.

#### 4. Documentation of Problems and Search Queries:
- Various search queries were used to resolve issues related to the assignment, with most yielding helpful results. The process was documented systematically.

## Summary of Homework 2

#### 1. Best Process Model for Different Projects:

- **Anti-lock Braking System**: Waterfall model is ideal due to its sequential, structured approach, ensuring thorough testing and validation at each stage.

- **Virtual Reality System for Software Maintenance**: Agile model is best, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and frequent iterations suitable for emerging technologies like VR.

- **University Accounting System**: Spiral model is chosen for its combination of risk management and flexibility, handling the systemâ€™s complexity and importance.

- **Interactive Travel Planning System**: Agile model is preferred for managing ever-changing user requirements, allowing frequent feedback and updates.

#### 2. Examples Suitable for the Waterfall Model:

- **Banking System**: A step-by-step approach minimizes errors and ensures the system meets financial requirements.

- **Medical Device Software**: The linear, thorough process meets regulatory and safety standards.

- **Bridge Design Software**: A sequential process ensures data accuracy and effectiveness in the final design.

#### 3. Examples Suitable for the Prototyping Model:

- **Mobile App Development**: Iterative design focuses on user feedback for usability and functionality.

- **E-commerce Website**: Rapid feedback enables testing of different designs and features.

- **Video Game Development**: Allows for experimentation with game elements and refinement based on beta testing feedback.

#### 4. Differences and Similarities Between Spiral and Incremental Models:

- **Difference**: Spiral focuses on risk management, while incremental focuses on delivering products incrementally.

- **Similarity**: Both models are iterative, flexible, and allow for changes during the development process, improving the final product over time.
