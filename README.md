### Course Description
Software Engineering Principles I introduces the holistic process of software development, focusing on requirement analysis and design phases, including object-oriented and functional paradigms. The course covers software processes, including lifecycle models, requirement engineering, design engineering, quality assurance, software testing, and software project management.

### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and describe software processes and lifecycle models.
- Apply methodologies for requirements engineering, design engineering, quality assurance, and project management.
- Elicit and model software requirements using UML.
- Derive software design and describe design models using UML.
- Develop basic skills in software testing and writing test cases.
