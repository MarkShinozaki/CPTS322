## Description of the Material
- The presentation titled "How to Write Good Use Cases" is a comprehensive guide on creating effective and clear use cases for system design and software requirements. The slides are structured to provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for identifying actors, outlining use cases, detailing use cases, and refining system definitions.

### Key Sections of the Presentation:
#### 1. Introduction to Use Cases:
- Explains the importance of use cases in defining functional requirements.
- Discusses when to use use cases versus declarative statements in system documentation.

#### 2. Process of Writing Use Cases:
- Outlines the steps to write use cases, including finding actors, finding use cases, outlining, and detailing use cases.
- Emphasizes that use case writing is an iterative process that evolves as more information is gathered.

#### 3. Finding Actors and Use Cases:
- Provides techniques to identify the actors (users, systems, or other entities) that interact with the system.
- Discusses how to define use cases based on the goals of these actors.

#### 4. Outlining Use Cases:
- Describes how to create an initial outline for use cases, including basic and alternative flows.
- Highlights the importance of identifying all possible scenarios, including regular, odd, and exceptional cases.

#### 5. Detailing Use Cases:
- Focuses on expanding the use case outline into a detailed flow of events, specifying what the actor does and how the system responds.
- Includes guidelines on phrasing steps clearly, managing the level of detail, and avoiding unnecessary design or UI details.

#### 6. Use Case Writing Tips:
- Offers advice on keeping use cases focused and concise.
- Discusses handling choices within flows, managing user interface details, and using glossaries to maintain consistency in terminology.

#### Summary:
- The presentation is a practical guide for anyone involved in system analysis, design, or development. It systematically explains the process of writing use cases, from identifying actors to detailing flows of events, and offers strategies for managing complexity. The focus is on creating clear, concise, and maintainable use cases that effectively communicate the systemâ€™s requirements without delving into implementation details.
