- For Milestone 1, the team focused on the FireMap project. They selected various tools and technologies, such as GitHub for version control, Discord for communication, Chrome web developer tools for web scraping, and VSCode for development. The technologies chosen include React for building the user interface, Leaflet for map functionality, HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the web pages, and Node.js for server-side operations. The team opted for the Incremental Process Model, which allows them to break down the project into smaller, manageable parts and deliver functionality iteratively. Each tool and technology was justified in the context of how it would help achieve the project’s goals.

- For Milestone 2, the team again worked on the FireMap project. They identified stakeholders such as wildfire operational resources, government wildfire organizations, the general public, and Incident Management Team (IMT) personnel. The project aims to create an online map that aggregates various wildfire-related data sources into a single, near-real-time interface. The team developed use case diagrams and detailed descriptions of each use case, such as displaying a map, selecting map layers, and gathering weather forecast information. The diagrams and descriptions were created using a professional UML tool to ensure clarity and precision.

### [Project Milestone 3](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/tree/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%203)

#### Milestone 3: Class-Based Modeling
##### [Rubric Summary](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%203/milestone-3.pdf) :
The objective of Milestone 3 is to refine customer requirements by identifying the class-based elements of the requirements model. This milestone focuses on data modeling, where the team is expected to deliver class diagrams, package diagrams, and CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborator) index cards. The diagrams should detail the relationships between classes and provide a clear model of the system's structure without delving into implementation details. The rubric emphasizes the importance of using professional tools for drawing these diagrams and requires that the work be comprehensive and clearly show relationships between the elements.

For Milestone 3, the FireMap team created several class diagrams, package diagrams, and CRC index cards to represent the structure of their project. These diagrams outlined the key classes involved in the system, such as those responsible for selecting map layers, viewing wildfire markers, and retrieving information. The team used these models to clarify the roles of different classes, their responsibilities, and how they collaborate. The diagrams were created using professional UML tools and ensured that relationships between classes were well defined. The CRC cards further helped in understanding the responsibilities of each class and their interactions with other classes.

##### [Rubric Summary](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%204/milestone-4-1.pdf) :
Milestone 4 is centered on proposing a high-level architecture for the project, identifying key components and their connections. The focus is on architectural design, where the team needs to develop an architectural context diagram and component diagrams. These diagrams are essential for representing the architectural context of the software and showing how the components interact within the system. The rubric requires using UML tools for drawing these diagrams and emphasizes the need for clear and concise representation of the system's architecture.

For Milestone 4, the FireMap team developed an architectural context diagram and component diagrams to outline the system's high-level architecture. The architectural context diagram positioned the FireMap system within its broader environment, showing how it interacts with external systems and stakeholders. The component diagrams broke down the system into its core components, such as data scraping modules, user interface components, and backend processing units. These diagrams provided a clear picture of how the different parts of the system would work together to achieve the project's goals.

### [Project Milestone 5](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/tree/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%205)

#### Milestone 5: Component-Level Design
##### [Rubric Summary](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%205/milestone-5.pdf) :
The objective of Milestone 5 is to proceed with the architectural design and develop detailed design specifications for each component identified in previous milestones. This milestone focuses on the component-level design as part of the overall design modeling process. The deliverables include elaborated component diagrams and class diagrams for each component, identifying data attributes, operations, and interfaces. The diagrams should be detailed enough to allow the team to move directly into implementation in the next phase. The rubric emphasizes the importance of clearly specifying data types, initial values, and processing logic where applicable.

##### [What Was Done](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%205/firemap_milestone5%20(Component-level%20design).pdf) :
For Milestone 5, the FireMap team created elaborated component diagrams and class diagrams for the main components of the system, such as the map component, loading component, and sidebar component. These diagrams were enhanced with detailed attributes, operations, and interfaces, providing a clear blueprint for implementation. The elaborated diagrams ensured that every aspect of the component, from data types to processing logic, was well-defined, enabling a smooth transition from design to coding. The team’s submission included all required diagrams and adhered to the guidelines specified in the rubric.

##### [Rubric Summary](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%206/milestone-6.pdf) :
Milestone 6 focuses on the implementation phase, where the design created in Milestone 5 is converted into working code. The main goal is to implement each component based on the detailed design, ensuring consistency between the design and the actual code. The rubric highlights the importance of following the design closely, ensuring that all components have corresponding code in the repository. Although the implementation does not need to be fully functional at this stage, each component must be represented in the codebase. The submission should include a link to the code repository and a brief description of the code.

For Milestone 6, the FireMap team implemented the components designed in Milestone 5. They developed the code for the map, loading, and sidebar components, ensuring that each component adhered to the design specifications. The implementation was pushed to the team’s GitHub repository, which was linked in the submission. The submission also included a brief description of the project and the code, providing an overview of the work done. The implementation stage was focused on converting the design into code, setting up the foundation for a functioning prototype to be demonstrated later.

### [Project Milestone 7](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/tree/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%207)

#### Milestone 7: Testing
##### [Rubric Summary](https://github.com/MarkShinozaki/CPTS322-SoftwareEngineeringPrinciples1/blob/Project-Milestones/Project%20Milestone%207/milestone-7.pdf) :
Milestone 7 focuses on testing the implementation developed in previous milestones. The goal is to create unit test cases for each component of the system. The team must describe at least one unit test case for each component, detailing the test type, test target, input, and expected output. The rubric emphasizes the importance of testing each component individually to ensure that the implementation aligns with the design and functions correctly.

For Milestone 7, the FireMap team developed unit test cases for various components of the system, including the Map, Sidebar, and Toggle components. Each test case was carefully constructed to verify that the component works as expected. For example, the Map component was tested to ensure it correctly renders a fire marker when provided with specific fire data. The Sidebar component was tested to verify that it accurately displays fire information, such as location and incident size, based on input data. The team documented these test cases in detail, outlining the test inputs and expected outputs for each component.
